# VBA Stock Market Analysis Code Explanation

## Introduction

This README explains the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code used for analyzing stock market data within an Excel workbook. The code computes yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock ticker and applies conditional formatting to highlight the changes.

## Code Sections

- **Loop Through Stock Data**: Initializes variables for tracking stock data and loops through each row, performing calculations when the stock ticker changes.

- **Calculate Yearly Change**: Computes the difference between the opening price at the start of the year and the closing price at the end of the year.

- **Calculate Percentage Change**: Determines the percentage change from the beginning to the end of the year and outputs it to the worksheet.

- **Calculate Total Stock Volume**: Aggregates the total traded volume for each ticker throughout the year.

- **Conditional Formatting**: Applies color formatting to the cells containing yearly change to visually represent the data.

- **Identify Greatest Increase, Decrease, and Volume**: After processing all tickers, the macro identifies the ones with the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.

- **Loop Across All Worksheets**: Enables the macro to run on every sheet in the workbook to perform the analysis on multiple datasets simultaneously.

## Conclusion

The macro automates data analysis tasks in Excel, providing quick insights into stock market trends and making data visualization straightforward and efficient.
